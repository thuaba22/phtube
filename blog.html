    <h1>Exploring JavaScript & REST API</h1>
    <h2>1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
    <p> In JavaScript, the scope of variables defined with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> differs. 
        <code>var</code> has function scope, which means it is accessible throughout the entire function in which it is declared. 
        <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> have block scope, limiting their accessibility to the block in which they are defined. 
        Additionally, variables declared with <code>const</code> cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set, while 
        <code>let</code> allows for reassignment.</p>

    <h2>2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
    <p><code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are both used to represent missing or empty values in JavaScript. <code>null</code> is an intentional absence of any object value and is often used to indicate that a variable should have no value. <code>undefined</code> is typically the value assigned to a variable that has been declared but not yet initialized. It can also be used to represent the absence of a property in an object. Understanding when to use <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> depends on the specific use case and the desired semantics.</p>

    <h2>3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
    <p> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
